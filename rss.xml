        Blunderday is a daily history podcast about the days humanity absolutely blew it. Starting in 1980 and moving forward, one regrettable date at a time. Each episode revisits a specific day in modern history and unpacks the bad ideas, terrible decisions, unchecked overconfidence, and “this seemed smart at the time” moments that turned an ordinary date into a full-scale historical faceplant. From political meltdowns and corporate self-destruction to pop culture disasters and plans fueled by ego, panic, or pure vibes, Blunderday delivers short, funny stories with sharp commentary and the unfair advantage of hindsight. No heroes. No inspirational speeches. Just proof that modern history is one long chain of “oh crap, what did we do?

    <title>The Five Sentences That Helped Break Medicine</title>
    <description><![CDATA[January 10, 1980 delivers three very different train wrecks. A five sentence letter in The New England Journal of Medicine claims addiction is rare in hospitalized patients treated with narcotics and gets wildly misused for decades as a free pass for opioid prescribing. The United States quietly kicks off a long, messy legacy by shipping weapons to Pakistan for Afghan fighters, turning Cold War strategy into a forever headache. Then the Boston Bruins give goalie Jim Stewart his first NHL start, and he gives up five goals in one brutal period, never to play in the league again. One day, three flavor profiles of regret.]]></description>
