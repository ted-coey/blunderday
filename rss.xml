        Blunderday is a daily history podcast about the days humanity absolutely blew it. Starting in 1980 and moving forward, one regrettable date at a time. Each episode revisits a specific day in modern history and unpacks the bad ideas, terrible decisions, unchecked overconfidence, and “this seemed smart at the time” moments that turned an ordinary date into a full-scale historical faceplant. From political meltdowns and corporate self-destruction to pop culture disasters and plans fueled by ego, panic, or pure vibes, Blunderday delivers short, funny stories with sharp commentary and the unfair advantage of hindsight. No heroes. No inspirational speeches. Just proof that modern history is one long chain of “oh crap, what did we do?

    <title>The Night Hartford’s Shiny New Arena Ate Its Own Roof</title>
    <description><![CDATA[January 18 comes with receipts. First up is Hartford’s proud new civic center, where a flashy long span roof design met physics, snow load, and wishful thinking before collapsing in the middle of the night. Then Capital Airlines Flight 20 flies into winter icing and delayed anti ice procedures that turn a routine hop into a fatal crash. Finally, Washington, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry manages to get himself filmed smoking crack in a hotel room while the FBI rolls tape. Structural hubris, cockpit overconfidence, and political self destruction all collide under the same date.]]></description>
